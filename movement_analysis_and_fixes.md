I'll review the provided files (`AqueductsBot.csproj`, `AqueductsBotSettings.cs`, and `AqueductsBot.cs`) to identify issues, particularly focusing on movement-related problems since you mentioned issues with the bot's movement. I'll assume the Radar plugin and ExileApi are functioning correctly, as stated. The review will cover code quality, potential bugs, movement-specific issues, and suggested fixes, with a focus on actionable improvements.

---

### Overview of Files
- **AqueductsBot.csproj**: The project file defines a .NET 8.0 Windows library with dependencies on ExileCore, GameOffsets, ImGui.NET, Newtonsoft.Json, and SharpDX.Mathematics. It enables unsafe code and dynamic loading.
- **AqueductsBotSettings.cs**: Defines the settings for the bot, organized into submenus (BotSettings, RadarSettings, MovementSettings, TimingSettings, DebugSettings, ConfigurationSettings). It uses ExileCore's attributes for UI integration.
- **AqueductsBot.cs**: The main plugin logic, implementing a state machine for pathfinding in Path of Exile's Aqueducts area. It uses Windows API for input simulation (mouse and keyboard), integrates with the Radar plugin for pathfinding, and includes extensive logging and debug visualization.

### General Code Observations
Before diving into movement-specific issues, here are some general observations about the code quality and structure:
1. **Positive Aspects**:
   - The code is well-organized with clear separation of settings and logic.
   - Extensive logging and debug options (`DebugSettings`) aid troubleshooting.
   - The state machine (`BotState`) is well-defined, making the bot's behavior predictable.
   - The use of a pure pursuit algorithm for movement is a robust approach for smooth navigation.
   - Error handling is present in most critical sections, reducing crash risks.

2. **General Concerns**:
   - **Code Length**: `AqueductsBot.cs` is very long (~3200 lines), making it hard to maintain. Consider refactoring into smaller classes (e.g., separate movement, pathfinding, and input handling).
   - **Commented-Out Code**: There are commented-out variables (e.g., `_pathfindingFailures`, `_lastPathfindingFailure`) that should be removed or documented for future use.
   - **Thread Safety**: While logging uses locks (`_logLock`, `_movementDebugLock`), other shared state (e.g., `_currentPath`) may be accessed concurrently in async callbacks. This needs verification.
   - **Hardcoded Values**: Some constants (e.g., `MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS = 2`, margins, timeouts) could be moved to settings for flexibility.

### Movement-Specific Issues and Analysis
The bot's movement relies on simulating mouse clicks or keyboard input to follow a path provided by the Radar plugin. The movement logic uses a pure pursuit algorithm, targeting points on a circle (radius defined by `PursuitRadius`) around the player to maintain smooth navigation. Below are identified issues related to movement, based on the code and your report of movement problems:

#### 1. **Inconsistent Input Simulation (Mouse and Keyboard)**
**Issue**: The bot supports both mouse clicks and keyboard movement (via `UseMovementKey`). The code includes multiple methods for keyboard input (`PressKey`, `PressKeyAlternative`, `PressKeyToWindow`, `PressKeyWithFocus`, `PressKeyWithScanCode`), suggesting issues with reliable key delivery to Path of Exile. This could cause the character to fail to move or move erratically.

**Evidence**:
- The `PressKey` method uses `keybd_event`, which may not reliably work with modern games due to focus issues or anti-cheat systems.
- Alternative methods (`PressKeyWithFocus`, `PressKeyToWindow`) attempt to focus the game window, indicating past issues with input delivery.
- The `TestMouseClick` and `TestMovementSystem` methods include extensive logging, suggesting previous debugging efforts for movement failures.
- The fallback to mouse clicks (`ClickAt`) when keyboard movement is disabled indicates a lack of confidence in keyboard input reliability.

**Impact**: If keyboard input fails (e.g., due to window focus issues or anti-cheat detection), the character may not move, or movement may be inconsistent. Mouse clicks may also fail if screen coordinates are miscalculated or the game window is not focused.

**Suggested Fixes**:
- **Standardize Input Method**: Choose one reliable input method (preferably mouse clicks, as they are more commonly used in PoE bots). Remove redundant keyboard input methods to reduce complexity.
  ```csharp
  private void PerformMovement(int screenX, int screenY)
  {
      ClickAt(screenX, screenY); // Focus on mouse clicks for simplicity
  }
  ```
- **Ensure Window Focus**: Before sending input, verify the PoE window is focused using `SetForegroundWindow` and validate with `GetForegroundWindow`.
  ```csharp
  private bool EnsureGameWindowFocused()
  {
      IntPtr poeWindow = FindWindow(null, "Path of Exile");
      if (poeWindow == IntPtr.Zero) return false;
      if (GetForegroundWindow() != poeWindow)
      {
          SetForegroundWindow(poeWindow);
          Thread.Sleep(50); // Allow time for focus
      }
      return GetForegroundWindow() == poeWindow;
  }
  ```
- **Use SendInput for Mouse**: Replace `mouse_event` with `SendInput` for more reliable mouse input, as it's the preferred Windows API for modern applications.
  ```csharp
  private void ClickAt(int x, int y)
  {
      if (!EnsureGameWindowFocused()) return;
      SetCursorPos(x, y);
      INPUT[] inputs = new INPUT[2];
      inputs[0] = CreateMouseInput(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 0, 0);
      inputs[1] = CreateMouseInput(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 0, 0);
      SendInput(2, inputs, Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(INPUT)));
  }

  private INPUT CreateMouseInput(uint flags, uint dx, uint dy)
  {
      return new INPUT
      {
          Type = INPUT_MOUSE,
          Data = { Mouse = new MOUSEINPUT { Flags = flags, Dx = (int)dx, Dy = (int)dy } }
      };
  }
  ```
- **Log Input Failures**: Add logging to detect when inputs fail (e.g., character doesn't move after a click).
  ```csharp
  private void ClickAt(int x, int y)
  {
      var playerPosBefore = GetPlayerPosition()?.GridPos;
      // ... perform click ...
      Thread.Sleep(100);
      var playerPosAfter = GetPlayerPosition()?.GridPos;
      if (playerPosBefore == playerPosAfter)
          LogMovementDebug($"[INPUT FAILURE] Character did not move after clicking at ({x}, {y})");
  }
  ```

#### 2. **Stuck Detection and Recovery Inefficiency**
**Issue**: The bot has stuck detection (`StuckDetectionThreshold`, `PathAdvancementDistance`), but the implementation is incomplete or ineffective. The code tracks `_stuckTargetCount` and `_stuckPositionHistory`, but the logic for advancing when stuck (e.g., in `MoveAlongPath`) is rudimentary and may fail to recover from obstacles or tight corners.

**Evidence**:
- In `MoveAlongPath`, if `FindPerimeterTarget` fails, the fallback advances `_currentPathIndex` by 3, which is arbitrary and may skip critical waypoints.
  ```csharp
  _currentPathIndex = Math.Min(_currentPathIndex + 3, _currentPath.Count - 1);
  ```
- The stuck detection logic checks if the target point hasn't changed (`_lastTargetPoint`), but it doesn't robustly verify if the player's position is static over time.
- The `PathAdvancementDistance` setting (default 100 pixels) is used when stuck, but its application is unclear, as it's not referenced in the provided code snippet.

**Impact**: The bot may get stuck in corners, near walls, or on obstacles, repeatedly clicking the same invalid point or failing to progress along the path.

**Suggested Fixes**:
- **Enhance Stuck Detection**: Use a time-based check to confirm the player hasn't moved significantly over multiple updates.
  ```csharp
  private bool IsPlayerStuck()
  {
      var currentPos = GetPlayerPosition()?.GridPos;
      if (currentPos == null) return false;

      var currentPosNum = new System.Numerics.Vector2(currentPos.Value.X, currentPos.Value.Y);
      _stuckPositionHistory.Add(currentPosNum);
      if (_stuckPositionHistory.Count > Settings.MovementSettings.StuckDetectionThreshold.Value)
          _stuckPositionHistory.RemoveAt(0);

      if (_stuckPositionHistory.Count < Settings.MovementSettings.StuckDetectionThreshold.Value)
          return false;

      var avgPos = new System.Numerics.Vector2(
          _stuckPositionHistory.Average(p => p.X),
          _stuckPositionHistory.Average(p => p.Y)
      );
      var maxDistance = _stuckPositionHistory.Max(p => System.Numerics.Vector2.Distance(p, avgPos));
      return maxDistance < Settings.MovementSettings.MovementPrecision.Value;
  }
  ```
- **Recovery Strategy**: When stuck, try alternative points (e.g., nearby waypoints or random points within `PursuitRadius`) instead of blindly advancing the path index.
  ```csharp
  private void HandleStuckSituation()
  {
      LogMovementDebug("[STUCK] Player detected as stuck - attempting recovery");
      if (_currentPathIndex + 1 < _currentPath.Count)
      {
          _currentPathIndex++; // Try next waypoint
          LogMovementDebug($"[STUCK] Advancing to waypoint {_currentPathIndex}");
      }
      else
      {
          // Request a new path if at the end
          LogMovementDebug("[STUCK] At path end - requesting new path");
          _currentState = BotState.GettingPath;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Integrate with MoveAlongPath**:
  ```csharp
  private void MoveAlongPath()
  {
      if (IsPlayerStuck())
      {
          HandleStuckSituation();
          return;
      }
      // ... existing movement logic ...
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Coordinate System Misalignment**
**Issue**: The bot uses multiple coordinate systems (world, grid, screen), and errors in conversion (e.g., between `SharpDX.Vector2` and `System.Numerics.Vector2`) or scaling could cause clicks to target incorrect locations, leading to movement failures.

**Evidence**:
- The `DebugCoordinateSystem` method logs extensive coordinate information, indicating past issues with coordinate calculations.
- The code mixes `SharpDX` and `System.Numerics` vector types, requiring manual conversions (e.g., in `TryConnectToRadar` and `MoveAlongPath`).
- The `ClickAt` method adjusts screen coordinates with window offsets, but errors in `GameController.Window.GetWindowRectangle()` (e.g., due to DPI scaling or multi-monitor setups) could offset clicks.
  ```csharp
  var windowRect = GameController.Window.GetWindowRectangle();
  int absoluteX = x + (int)windowRect.X;
  int absoluteY = y + (int)windowRect.Y;
  ```

**Impact**: Incorrect screen coordinates result in the character moving to the wrong location or not moving at all, especially in windowed mode or non-standard resolutions.

**Suggested Fixes**:
- **Validate Coordinate Conversions**: Add assertions or logging to ensure world-to-screen conversions are accurate.
  ```csharp
  private Vector2 WorldToScreen(System.Numerics.Vector2 worldPos)
  {
      var worldPos3 = new Vector3(worldPos.X, worldPos.Y, 0);
      var screenPos = GameController.IngameState.Camera.WorldToScreen(worldPos3);
      LogMovementDebug($"[COORDS] World ({worldPos.X:F0}, {worldPos.Y:F0}) → Screen ({screenPos.X:F0}, {screenPos.Y:F0})");
      return new Vector2(screenPos.X, screenPos.Y);
  }
  ```
- **Handle DPI Scaling**: Account for Windows DPI scaling when calculating absolute screen coordinates.
  ```csharp
  private void ClickAt(int x, int y)
  {
      var windowRect = GameController.Window.GetWindowRectangle();
      var dpiScale = GetDpiScale();
      int absoluteX = (int)(x * dpiScale + windowRect.X);
      int absoluteY = (int)(y * dpiScale + windowRect.Y);
      LogMovementDebug($"[CLICK] Adjusted for DPI {dpiScale:F2}: Game ({x}, {y}) → Absolute ({absoluteX}, {absoluteY})");
      SetCursorPos(absoluteX, absoluteY);
      // ... perform click ...
  }

  private float GetDpiScale()
  {
      using (var graphics = Graphics.FromHwnd(IntPtr.Zero))
      {
          return graphics.DpiX / 96f; // Standard DPI is 96
      }
  }
  ```
- **Test Coordinate Accuracy**: Enhance `DebugCoordinateSystem` to click at test points and verify character movement.
  ```csharp
  private void DebugCoordinateSystem()
  {
      // ... existing code ...
      LogMessage("STEP 7 - Testing click at test position");
      ClickAt(testX, testY);
      Thread.Sleep(500);
      var newPlayerPos = GetPlayerPosition()?.GridPos;
      LogMessage($"STEP 7 - Player moved to grid pos: ({newPlayerPos?.X ?? -1}, {newPlayerPos?.Y ?? -1})");
  }
  ```

#### 4. **Path Intersection and Pursuit Radius Issues**
**Issue**: The pure pursuit algorithm (`FindPerimeterTarget`, `FindPathIntersectionWithSpecificRadius`) aims to click at a fixed distance (`PursuitRadius`) from the player, but it may select invalid or unreachable points, especially if the path contains short segments or sharp turns.

**Evidence**:
- The `FindLineCircleIntersection` method skips short segments (`segmentLength < 0.5f`), which may ignore valid waypoints in dense paths.
  ```csharp
  if (segmentLength < 0.5f) continue;
  ```
- The fallback logic in `MoveAlongPath` uses `FindOnScreenPerimeterPoint` when the target is off-screen, but this may choose a direction unrelated to the path, causing erratic movement.
- The `CircleIntersectionTolerance` setting (default 0.1f) may be too strict, rejecting valid intersections if numerical precision issues arise.

**Impact**: The bot may click on points that don't advance the path, leading to zigzagging or failure to follow the Radar-provided path accurately.

**Suggested Fixes**:
- **Relax Segment Length Check**: Increase the minimum segment length to 1f or make it configurable to include more waypoints.
  ```csharp
  if (segmentLength < Settings.ConfigurationSettings.MinSegmentLength.Value) continue; // Add to ConfigurationSettings
  ```
- **Simplify Pursuit Logic**: If no valid intersection is found, fall back to the nearest waypoint within `PursuitRadius` instead of complex perimeter searches.
  ```csharp
  private System.Numerics.Vector2? FindPerimeterTarget(List<Vector2i> path, int startIndex)
  {
      var playerPos = GetPlayerPosition()?.GridPos;
      if (playerPos == null || path.Count == 0) return null;

      var playerWorldPos = new System.Numerics.Vector2(playerPos.Value.X, playerPos.Value.Y);
      var pursuitRadius = Settings.MovementSettings.PursuitRadius.Value;

      // Try intersection first
      var intersection = FindPathIntersectionWithSpecificRadius(path, startIndex, pursuitRadius);
      if (intersection.HasValue) return intersection;

      // Fallback: Use nearest waypoint within radius
      for (int i = startIndex; i < path.Count; i++)
      {
          var waypoint = new System.Numerics.Vector2(path[i].X, path[i].Y);
          var distance = System.Numerics.Vector2.Distance(playerWorldPos, waypoint);
          if (distance <= pursuitRadius && IsTargetPointValid(waypoint))
          {
              LogMovementDebug($"[FALLBACK] Using waypoint {i}: ({waypoint.X:F0}, {waypoint.Y:F0}), distance: {distance:F1}");
              return waypoint;
          }
      }

      LogMovementDebug("[PERIMETER] No valid target found");
      return null;
  }
  ```
- **Increase Tolerance**: Adjust `CircleIntersectionTolerance` default to 0.5f for more forgiving intersection detection.
  ```csharp
  public RangeNode<float> CircleIntersectionTolerance { get; set; } = new RangeNode<float>(0.5f, 0.05f, 1.0f);
  ```

#### 5. **Duplicate Click Detection Ineffectiveness**
**Issue**: The bot tracks duplicate clicks (`_duplicateClickCount`, `MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS`) to avoid spamming the same point, but the logic is incomplete and may not prevent repetitive clicks when stuck or when path updates are slow.

**Evidence**:
- The `_lastClickScreenPos` and `_duplicateClickCount` are updated in `ClickAt`, but there's no clear action taken when `MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS` is reached.
  ```csharp
  if (screenPos == _lastClickScreenPos)
      _duplicateClickCount++;
  else
      _duplicateClickCount = 0;
  ```
- The code doesn't integrate duplicate click detection with stuck recovery or path re-evaluation.

**Impact**: The bot may repeatedly click the same invalid point, wasting time or appearing bot-like, increasing detection risk.

**Suggested Fixes**:
- **Handle Duplicate Clicks**: Trigger stuck recovery or path re-request when duplicate clicks exceed the threshold.
  ```csharp
  private void ClickAt(int x, int y)
  {
      var screenPos = new System.Numerics.Vector2(x, y);
      if (screenPos == _lastClickScreenPos)
      {
          _duplicateClickCount++;
          if (_duplicateClickCount >= MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS)
          {
              LogMovementDebug("[DUPLICATE CLICK] Too many clicks at same position - triggering stuck recovery");
              HandleStuckSituation();
              _duplicateClickCount = 0;
              return;
          }
      }
      else
      {
          _duplicateClickCount = 0;
      }
      _lastClickScreenPos = screenPos;

      // ... existing click logic ...
  }
  ```
- **Increase Threshold**: Set `MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS` to 3 or make it configurable to allow brief retries before recovery.
  ```csharp
  private const int MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS = 3;
  ```

---

### Additional Issues (Non-Movement)
While the focus is on movement, these issues could indirectly affect movement or overall bot reliability:

1. **Radar Connection Robustness**:
   - **Issue**: The `TryConnectToRadar` method tries multiple signatures for `Radar.LookForRoute`, but if the Radar plugin updates its API, the bot may fail silently. The retry interval (`RadarRetryInterval`) is respected, but there's no fallback if all signatures fail permanently.
   - **Fix**: Add a timeout to transition to `BotState.Error` if Radar connection fails after multiple retries.
     ```csharp
     private void TryConnectToRadar()
     {
         if (_radarAvailable) return;
         // ... existing code ...
         if (!_radarAvailable)
         {
             _radarRetryCount++;
             if (_radarRetryCount > 5)
             {
                 LogError("Failed to connect to Radar after multiple attempts - entering error state");
                 _currentState = BotState.Error;
             }
         }
     }
     private int _radarRetryCount = 0;
     ```

2. **Path Staleness Detection**:
   - **Issue**: The `PathStalenessTime` setting (default 30s) marks paths as stale, but frequent path switching (due to `PathScoreThreshold` being low at 0.15f) may interrupt movement.
   - **Fix**: Increase `PathScoreThreshold` to 0.3f to reduce unnecessary path changes and ensure smoother movement.
     ```csharp
     public RangeNode<float> PathScoreThreshold { get; set; } = new RangeNode<float>(0.3f, 0.05f, 0.5f);
     ```

3. **Logging Performance**:
   - **Issue**: Excessive logging (especially in `LogMovementDebug`) with file writes on every movement update could degrade performance, delaying movement commands.
   - **Fix**: Buffer log messages and write to file periodically (e.g., every 1s).
     ```csharp
     private readonly List<string> _movementDebugBuffer = new List<string>();
     private DateTime _lastFileWrite = DateTime.MinValue;

     private void LogMovementDebug(string message)
     {
         if (Settings.DebugSettings.DebugMode.Value)
             LogMessage(message);

         if (!Settings.DebugSettings.SaveMovementDebugToFile.Value) return;

         lock (_movementDebugLock)
         {
             var timestamp = DateTime.Now.ToString("HH:mm:ss.fff");
             _movementDebugBuffer.Add($"[{timestamp}] {message}");

             if (DateTime.Now.Subtract(_lastFileWrite).TotalSeconds >= 1)
             {
                 File.AppendAllText(_movementDebugFilePath, string.Join(Environment.NewLine, _movementDebugBuffer) + Environment.NewLine);
                 _movementDebugBuffer.Clear();
                 _lastFileWrite = DateTime.Now;
             }
         }
     }
     ```

---

### Movement Testing Recommendations
To verify movement issues and test fixes:
1. **Enable Debug Visualization**: Set `ShowPathPoints`, `ShowPlayerCircle`, and `ShowMovementDebug` to true in `DebugSettings` to visualize the path and target points.
2. **Run Test Cases**:
   - Use `TestMouseClick` to confirm mouse clicks move the character to the correct location.
   - Use `TestMovementSystem` to test keyboard input if retained.
   - Manually navigate to a corner or obstacle in Aqueducts and observe stuck detection behavior.
3. **Log Analysis**: Review `_movementDebugFilePath` logs for:
   - Coordinate mismatches (world vs. screen).
   - Repeated clicks at the same position.
   - Stuck detection triggers.
4. **Adjust Settings**:
   - Increase `PursuitRadius` (e.g., to 400f) for smoother navigation.
   - Lower `MovementPrecision` (e.g., to 5f) for stricter waypoint detection.
   - Increase `StuckDetectionThreshold` (e.g., to 10) to reduce false positives.

---

### Summary of Key Fixes
1. **Input Simulation**:
   - Standardize on mouse clicks using `SendInput`.
   - Ensure game window focus before input.
   - Log input failures to detect issues.
2. **Stuck Detection**:
   - Implement robust position-based stuck detection.
   - Add recovery by trying nearby waypoints or re-requesting paths.
3. **Coordinate System**:
   - Validate world-to-screen conversions.
   - Handle DPI scaling for accurate clicks.
4. **Pursuit Algorithm**:
   - Relax segment length checks.
   - Fallback to nearest waypoint if intersection fails.
   - Increase `CircleIntersectionTolerance` to 0.5f.
5. **Duplicate Clicks**:
   - Trigger stuck recovery on excessive duplicate clicks.
   - Make `MAX_DUPLICATE_CLICKS` configurable.

---

### Next Steps
If you can share specific movement failure symptoms (e.g., character doesn't move, moves erratically, gets stuck) or logs from `_movementDebugFilePath`, I can refine the analysis further. Additionally, refactoring `AqueductsBot.cs` into smaller classes (e.g., `MovementManager`, `PathfindingManager`) would improve maintainability and make debugging easier.

Would you like me to provide a specific code patch for any of the above fixes (e.g., updated `ClickAt` or `MoveAlongPath`)? Alternatively, I can suggest a testing plan to isolate the movement issue using the debug tools provided in the bot.
